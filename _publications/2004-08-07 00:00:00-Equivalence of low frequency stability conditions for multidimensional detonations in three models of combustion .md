excerpt: 'We use the classical normal mode approach of hydrodynamic stability theory to define stability determinants (Evans functions) for multidimensional strong detonations in three commonly studied models of combustion: the full reactive Navier-Stokes ($\RNS$) model, and the simpler Zeldovich-von Neumann-D\&quot;oring ($\ZND$) and Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) models. The determinants are functions of frequencies $(\lambda,\eta)$, where $\lambda$ is a complex variable dual to the time variable, and $\eta\in\bR^{d-1}$ is dual to the transverse spatial variables. The zeros of these determinants in $\Re\lambda>0$ correspond to perturbations that grow exponentially with time. '
