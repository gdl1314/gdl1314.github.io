### Background. 
I am a mathematician by training. 

### Research Interests

Broadly, my early work focused on the behavior of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations. Many of the projects feature an interplay of tools and techniques from dynamical systems, functional analysis, and computation. 

More recently, my interests have broadened to include healthcare applications. I am especially interested in the interaction between data and model

### Oldies but goodies. 

Some older papers of which I am especially fond for one reason or another...
